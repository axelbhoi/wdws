									I have always secretly been an Agnostic in a highly radicalist Christian family. I now have a family of my own. Recently, my wife and I decided that we do not want to raise our kids as Christians. We want to raise them to think for themselves what religion they want to belong to when they grow up - or if they don't want to be in a religion all along. We just think that telling them that an invisible deity loves them but will threaten them with eternal fire doesn't seem like good parenting. Are we wrong in this?

									So I've been dating this girl for 2.3 years now, I was recently devastated to hear from a common friend how she spend the night in a hotel room with this guy she used to work with. I confronted her about it, she denied at first but then I kept pushing for the truth and then she cried and said she was sorry. So then I decided to cheat  on her too. I let her know about it. It was with her friend who kept trying to flirt with me. Now she doesn't want to talk to me and all her friends think I'm evi, except for that one common friend who told me she cheated. So im not sure how I feel right now. I just want to get it out there.

									There's nothing left for me in life. I don't have a job, no friends, no girlfriend, I'm ugly and socially awkward. I spent too much time playing videogames. I'm bi-polar and I can't afford to go to a doctor. I want to kill myself and get this over with. My life has always been a nightmare. I just don't want to leave my family like this but I don't want to live anymore either. HELP!
